# About This Project
The world is changing remarkably over the past few years. The one persistent thing is at the end we die. The health care over the last 20 years has
changed drastically. Today we live longer than our ancestors have lived due to the advancements in the health care facilities. It also led to the increase 
in life expectancy, however the modern lifestyle, change in daily habits, improved infrastructure is also making us lethargic. As per the World Health 
Organization, approximately 60 â€“ 85 percent of people around the globe lead inactive lifestyles that contribute to their health issues. The leading causes 
of death across the world still vary significantly, it is crucial to understand the causes that lead to death and the risk factors related to a precipitous
death. The aim of this project is to analyze the data and find patterns in the deaths caused due to various risk factors. We believe this project would 
help the governments and organizations to focus on better policy making and targeted spending on health care.
